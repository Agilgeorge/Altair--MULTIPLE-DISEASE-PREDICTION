# Altair Data Science Hackathon - Runner-Up Project

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the **Altair Data Science Hackathon**, where it secured the **first runner-up** position. The hackathon challenged participants to solve complex data science problems using **RapidMiner**, a powerful platform for data analysis, machine learning, and predictive analytics.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of the project was to [insert specific problem statement or goal here, e.g., "predict customer churn rates for a telecommunications company using historical data"].

## Tools and Technologies
- **RapidMiner**: Used for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- **Python**: Utilized for scripting and custom functions.
- **[Other Tools/Technologies]**: Mention any additional tools or libraries used.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: 
   - [Describe the dataset(s) used, e.g., "The dataset comprised customer demographic information, service usage patterns, and customer support interactions."]

2. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - [Outline the preprocessing steps, e.g., "Handled missing values, normalized numerical features, and encoded categorical variables."]

3. **Modeling**:
   - [Describe the models used, e.g., "Implemented decision trees, random forests, and logistic regression models to predict customer churn."]

4. **Evaluation**:
   - [Explain how the models were evaluated, e.g., "Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance."]

5. **Results**:
   - [Summarize the outcomes, e.g., "The random forest model achieved the highest accuracy of 85%, with a balanced precision and recall."]

## Key Learnings
- [Highlight any significant insights or challenges faced, e.g., "Gained experience in feature engineering and the importance of balancing datasets for classification tasks."]

## Conclusion
This project showcased the potential of **RapidMiner** in solving real-world data science problems effectively. The solutions developed not only addressed the hackathon's challenges but also demonstrated innovative approaches to predictive modeling.
